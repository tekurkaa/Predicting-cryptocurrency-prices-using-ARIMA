# Predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-using-ARIMA
In this study, we build an ARIMA(4,1,0) model to forecast short-term prices for Bitcoin and a portfolio. It shows an accuracy of 98% for Bitcoin predictions and of 97% for Bitcoin portfolio (cryptocurrencies with similar price trends as Bitcoin) predictions. These findings indicate a great fitting of the model for short-term predictions.
